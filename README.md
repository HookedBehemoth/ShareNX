### Site Configs
Site-specific configuration files can be created for uploading to other services, as well as changing the theme of the application itself. These can easily be selected in-app by pressing the X button at the main menu. Take a look at the [example configs](https://github.com/HookedBehemoth/screen-nx/tree/rewrite/config) to learn how to make them, and feel free to submit a pull request with your own creations!
